    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a hearty, filling, cold-weather soup that makes a meal served with a crusty bread and light salad. The soup is just not the same if the brats are not grilled.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 fresh bratwurst sausages</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
        <li>4 carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>4 ribs celery, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped garlic</li>
        <li>2 (32 ounce) cartons chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground thyme</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>6 potatoes, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>12 ounces spinach, coarsely chopped, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Grill bratwursts until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Cool. Slice each bratwurst into 1/4-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion, carrots, and celery in hot oil until onions are tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir garlic into onion mixture and cook until garlic is fragrant, 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken broth, tomatoes, sliced bratwurst, basil, parsley, thyme, and cayenne pepper into onion mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix potatoes into bratwurst mixture, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes are almost cooked through, 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir beans and spinach into pot; simmer until heated through and potatoes are done, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
